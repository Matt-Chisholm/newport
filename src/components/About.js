            I am a Front End Developer with a bootcamp background and a passion
            for UX. Great UI is what drew me to development initially and I
            haven't looked back. I am a tenacious self starter who is detail and
            results oriented, and love working personably in teams and with
            clients. What I love most about development is the constant
            challenge and growth it provides, while providing an opportunity to
            learn each day. I am currently volunteering my time to several
            applications for non profit organizations and freelancing while I
            continue my career journey.
